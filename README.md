# ebird-datasets
Importing various datasets and storing as (relatively) compressed R DATA files to use for later analyses.

`group-accounts/` concerns the Indian eBirding community. The objective is to create a list of group accounts (accounts not used by an individual, instead created in order to aggregate data from certain birding events or groups) present in the eBird dataset from India, and to regularly update this, so these can then be removed from major analyses.
